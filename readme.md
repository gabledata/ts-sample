# Cabbage

Cabbage is a "full-fat" example project that I use for learning about
[Supabase](https://github.com/supabase/supabase).

I also publish articles on the [Kopi blog](http://kopi.cloud/blog/) using 
Cabbage as a worked example. Yes, those articles are (partly) content marketing 
for Kopi. 

The `tst` branch is published at:
[rabbit-cabbage.netlify.app](https://rabbit-cabbage.netlify.app/)

Ask questions or make suggestions in the Discussions or Issues section of the Github repo.


## Structure 

* [.github](/.github) - github action config
* [/app/](/app) - client app
* [/database/](/database) - database schema management
* [/doc/](/doc) - misc documentation, notes, etc.
* [/gradle/](/gradle) - gradle wrapper stuff
  * used for bootstrapping Gradle


I'm using [Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html),
[Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/documentation/), Java etc. just because they're
the tools that I know best.  
I'm not saying this is the Correct Way to do things.
