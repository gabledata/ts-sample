# cabbage

Cabbage is my play area for learning about 
[Supabase](https://github.com/supabase/supabase).

Doesn't even have an app that uses the DB yet, at the moment it's just code 
for managing a schema across different SB databases ("projects").

I'm using Gradle, Flyway, Java etc. just because they're the tools that I know 
best, not saying this is the right way to do it.
