* create a function to do increment and read of welcome count in a single call
  on server side
* add a refresh button to the cabbage count, to re-read without bumping
* make the cabbage count realtime
  * this would be... not a good idea on a real app, unless SB is magic :P
* upgrade navigation infra to allow triggering DB reads before beginning the
  screen transition
