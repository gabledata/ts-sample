This directory is a standalone project  - it's not part of the Cabbage app. 
The project's purpose is to show the auth issue I was having with supabase
in a simplified context.

The interesting code is in [EmailLogin.tsx](./src/EmailLogin.tsx)


This is a basic react project; created with create-react-app, 
then stripped of all the noise that c-r-a adds.
